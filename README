## MCFTLE: Monte Carlo Rendering of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent Fields ##
###########################################################################


This folder contains a (minimal) cross-platform implementation of MCFTLE.

========================
== CPU implementation ==
========================

Requirements:
- C++ 11                 (tested on Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio 2017, GCC 4.8 and GCC 5)
- CMake                  (tested with CMake 3.4.1)

Tested on:
- Windows 7
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS


Please be patient. A single iteration might take a few minutes (15 seconds on our testing machine).
Intermediate results are written as bmp files to the build folder.
This implementation is not optimized and does not contain an acceleration data structure.
The source code is kept simple and is meant for educational purposes only.


========================
== GPU implementation ==
========================

Requirements:
- C++ 11                             (tested on Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and 2017)
- CMake                              (tested with CMake 3.4.1)
- Windows 7, DirectX SDK (June 2010) 
- Windows 10, Windows 10 SDK         (tested for Fall Creatores Update 10.0.16299.x)


The GPU implementation dispatches a compute shader that has a potentially long execution time (about 1 second on our testing machine).
In fact, the Windows Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) might think that the system hangs and reset the graphics driver.
To prevent this from happening, the following registry flag can be set:

KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrLevel
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : 0				 # TdrLevelOff(0) = Detection disabled 

Intermediate results are written as bmp and pfm files to the build folder.
